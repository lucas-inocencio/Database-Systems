# Database-Systems

This project contains a comprehensive database for vaccination data of the unified health system (SUS) of Brazil, modeled in ERWin and migrated to an equivalent SQL in Microsoft SQL Server. 
Additionally, it includes a RESTful API built using Node.js for seamless integration of the database with other applications.

It is primary based on Fundamentals of Database Systems by Elmasri and Navathe.
